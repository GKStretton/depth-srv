These are the files to set up my home server. The server is always on and runs software relating to my projects and smart home setup.

- Mosquitto MQTT broker for use with Tasmota smart plugs and A Study of Light.
- Home Assistant for smart home control and automation
- Grafana for dashboard visualisation of data from A Study of Light (WIP)

Requires .env with HOME_DIR defined as your ~ expansion, and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
